---

**KAPLAYGROUND** is a powerful, web-based editor designed specifically for creating, editing, and sharing KAPLAY game projects — all from your browser.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Multi-file Editing**\
  Work on full projects with **multiple files** or quickly prototype with a **single script**.

- 📂 **Project Browser**\
  Open and load KAPLAY projects directly from your local machine.

- 🍺 **Asset Brew**\
  Quickly import a curated set of default assets to kickstart your projects or examples.

- 🌲 **File Tree Navigation**\
  Browse your project structure with an intuitive file tree sidebar.

- 🛠️ **Code Editor**\
  Use a modern, powerful code editor based in VS Code, with features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting and special KAPLAY snippets and autocompletion.

- 🤖 **WebMCP Agent Tools**\
  Let compatible browser agents inspect the current project, read and safely replace files, select files, run or stop the preview, and inspect diagnostics and console output.

## WebMCP

This fork registers twelve `kaplayground_*` tools through the browser's WebMCP API. File replacement and removal use the revision returned by `kaplayground_read_file`, so an agent cannot silently overwrite or delete a newer editor change.
